1. Hotel Environment
   1. Case 1: Delivery Constraints
      - Without Human in the Loop
        - Starting beta = 30
        - Starting beta = 0
        - Incomplete workspace: missing edge 
        - Incomplete workspace: missing node
      - With Human in the Loop 
        - Starting beta = 30, after IRL beta decrease (pass though c4)
        - Starting beta = 30, afterl IRL beta doesn't change (pass though r5)
        - Temporal task: from r0 to r7 in 1000 sec (feasible)
        - Temporal task: from r0 to r7 in 10 sec (feasible with delay)
        - Temporal task: from r8 to r5 in 50 sec (not feasible)
        - Modify smooth mix parameters: ds = 5 m and epsilon = 2 m
